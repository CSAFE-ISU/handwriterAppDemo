Handwriter is designed to assist forensic examiners by analyzing
handwritten documents against a closed set of potential writers. It
determines the probability that each writer wrote the document. Whether
you are a forensic document examiner, legal professional, academic, or
simply curious about how statistics are applied to handwriting,
handwriter provides an automated way to evaluate handwriting samples.

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub.
